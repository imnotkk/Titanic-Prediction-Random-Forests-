# Titanic-Prediction-Random-Forests-
This is my approach to The Kaggle's famous problem - Titanic Survival. I've used Random forests and tuned it using GridSeachCV.

I've also added the visualisation notebook which can be used to see various relationship between the features adn which are important.
I've tried to comment and help explain everthing in the notebook.

I've used RandomForestClassifier and used GridSearchCV to tune the parameters to get the best results.
